Having fun with RubyMotion
==========
Here are a few demo apps from the [talk](http://www.meetup.com/IsraelRubyUnderground/events/116715242/).
You can check out the slides at [slide desk](https://speakerdeck.com/yasha0x80/having-fun-with-rubymotion) or just grab them here with the repo.
Tell [me](mailto:hello@yaakov.io) what you think.
I'll be adding some comments to the code soon.
Enjoy!
